## Project Root

Your working directory is `{{workdir}}`. Start every iteration with `cd {{workdir}}`.

## Iteration State

- Iteration: **{{iteration}}** of **{{max_iterations}}**
- Task file: `{{tasks_path}}`
- Iteration log: `{{log_path}}`

## Working Files

You have two critical files that persist across iterations. Read them first and update them as you work.

**Task file** (`{{tasks_path}}`):
- Contains phased tasks and reflection gates
- Mark tasks `[/]` when starting, `[x]` when complete
- Add new tasks if dependencies or follow-ups are discovered

**Iteration log** (`{{log_path}}`):
- Records prior outcomes, errors, and lessons
- Use it to avoid repeating failed attempts
