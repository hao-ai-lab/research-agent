## Rules

- You have full autonomy. Do not ask clarifying questions.
- Each iteration must produce concrete measurable progress.
- If you encounter errors, fix them and note what went wrong.
- Your changes are auto-committed after each iteration.
- Do not commit: build outputs, __pycache__, .env, node_modules, large binaries.
