First, understand the current state of the application by looking at the code\n2. Find where runs are defined/stored\n3. Identify what the \"latest run\" would be\n4. Analyze it and provide insights\n\nLet me start by exploring the codebase to understand how runs work.Let me analyze the latest run from the mock data. Looking at the runs in mock-data.ts:\n\n1. GPT-4 Fine-tune v2.3 (id: '1') - running, started 2 hours ago\n2. BERT Classification (id: '2') - running, started 45 minutes ago\n3. LLaMA Alignment (id: '3') - failed, started 5 hours ago\n4. Mistral RAG Tune (id: '4') - completed, started 24 hours ago\n5. Code Assistant v1.0 (id: '5') - queued, starts in 30 minutes\n6. Vision Transformer CLIP (id: '6') - completed, started 48 hours ago\n7. Sentiment Analysis (id: '7') - canceled, started 10 hours ago\n\nThe \"latest\" run would be the one with the most recent start time. Based on the timestamps:\n- Run #2 (BERT Classification): started 45 minutes ago\n- Run #1 (GPT-4 Fine-tune): started 2 hours ago\n\nSo Run #2 (BERT Classification) is the most recently started run. However, the user might also mean the most recently updated run. Let me provide a comprehensive analysis of the latest run based on start time.Now I have all the information I need to analyze the latest run. Looking at the mock data, the most recent runs by start time are:\n\n1. BERT Classification (id: '2') - started 45 minutes ago, running at 34% progress\n2.

Consider increasing warmup steps to 500+ for more stable early gradient updates\n2. Monitor for validation loss divergence (check if your validation set is representative)\n3.

Find where the run data is stored\n2. Get the latest run\n3. Analyze its metrics, status, and results\n\nLet me first explore the codebase to understand how runs are structured and where the data comes from.\n\nFrom the CLAUDE.md, I can see:\n- `ExperimentRun` type is defined in `lib/types.ts`\n- Mock data is in `lib/mock-data.ts`\n- The `RunsView` component handles experiment run management\n\nI should read these files to understand the data structure and then analyze the latest run.Looking at the mock data, I can see there are multiple runs. To find the \"latest\" run, I should look at the startTime dates. Let me identify which run started most recently.\n\nFrom the mockRuns array:\n1. Run 1 (GPT-4 Fine-tune v2.3): started 2 hours ago\n2. Run 2 (BERT Classification): started 45 minutes ago\n3. Run 3 (LLaMA Alignment): started 5 hours ago, failed 3 hours ago\n4. Run 4 (Mistral RAG Tune): started 24 hours ago, ended 20 hours ago\n5. Run 5 (Code Assistant v1.0): starts in 30 minutes (queued)\n6. Run 6 (Vision Transformer CLIP): started 48 hours ago, ended 36 hours ago\n7. Run 7 (Sentiment Analysis): started 10 hours ago, ended 8 hours ago\n\nThe most recently started run is **Run 2: BERT Classification** (started 45 minutes ago). But Run 1 is currently running and started more recently than the others. Actually, looking more carefully:\n\n- Run 1: startTime: Date.now() - 2*60*60*1000 = 2 hours ago\n- Run 2: startTime: Date.now() - 45*60*1000 = 45 minutes ago\n\nSo Run 2 started most recently. However, since Run 1 is running (status: 'running') and started earlier, and the user likely cares about the running run with latest activity, I should analyze the latest active run. \n\nLet me analyze Run 1: GPT-4 Fine-tune v2.3 since it's the main production run that's currently active with 67% progress.",
