# Issue 8

## GH Issue Summary

- `gh issue view 8` currently fails because outbound connections to `api.github.com` are blocked in this sandbox (`error connecting to api.github.com`).
- I do not have any cached description for this issue inside the repo.

## Empathy Notes

- Need the user's description or acceptance criteria to relate to the problem space.
- Once I have it I can capture user quotes, pain points, and desired outcomes here.

## Clarified Goal

- Blocked pending access to the actual GitHub issue text.

## Design Doc

- Will be drafted after the issue body is available.

## Implementation Plan

1. Obtain the source issue requirements.
2. Translate them into UX/data changes and identify affected modules.
3. Sequence the implementation steps and verification plan.

## Progress Log

- Iteration 1: Recorded inability to read the issue because `gh` cannot reach GitHub from the current environment.
